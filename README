My haphazard collection of dotfiles.

    http://sdt.github.com/.dotfiles/

The dotfiles themselves all lives in a .dotfiles subdirectory, to avoid my
whole home directory tree being a git repo.

There's three basic strategies to get various programs to use a dotfile outside
the usual place. In order of preference, they are:

  1. ~/.programrc includes ~/.dotfiles/programrc

    This of course requires the dotfile have some kind of include mechanism.

  2. Environment variable: PROGRAM_CONFIG=~/.dotfiles/programrc

  3. Invocation alias: alias program='program --config-file=~/.dotfiles/programrc'


The included install.sh takes care of setting up the first form. It tries to be idempotent,
but should not be fully trusted.

The other forms are set up in bashrc.

    For my own convenience, I've copied some third-party files into my .dotfiles
    tree. These are listed below. Please contact me if you're not happy about me
    using these.
