I've added my unix dotfiles to github at https://github.com/sdt/Dotfiles/

The pattern is that the default .$DOTFILE sources .sdt.$DOTFILE, so that the
customisations are all in .sdt.$DOTFILE. Further machine-specific customisations
are in an optional file .sdt.$DOTFILE.local, which is not committed.
