I've added my unix dotfiles to github at https://github.com/sdt/Dotfiles/

The pattern is that the default ~/.$DOTFILE sources ~/.dotfiles/$DOTFILE, so
that the customisations are all in ~/.dotfiles/$DOTFILE. Further
machine-specific customisations are in an optional file
~/.dotfiles/$DOTFILE.local, which is not committed.

Another pattern is for bashrc to set an environment variable pointing to an
alternative dotfile, eg. DZIL_GLOBAL_CONFIG_ROOT=$HOME/.dotfiles/dzil


There'a an install.sh script which installs/updates various triggers and hooks
outside the .dotfiles directory. Use at own risk!



Acknowledgements:

    For my own convenience, I've copied some third-party files into my .dotfiles
    tree. These are listed below. Please contact me if you're not happy about me
    using these.
