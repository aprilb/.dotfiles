I've added my unix dotfiles to github at https://github.com/sdt/Dotfiles/

The pattern is that the default ~/.$DOTFILE sources ~/.dotfiles/$DOTFILE, so
that the customisations are all in ~/.dotfiles/$DOTFILE. Further 
machine-specific customisations are in an optional file 
~/.dotfiles/$DOTFILE.local, which is not committed.

There'a an install.sh script which appends the following lines to the 
appropriate system dotfiles. Use at own risk.

Sample usages:
    .bashrc:
        source ~/.dotfiles/bashrc

    .vimrc
        source ~/.dotfiles/vimrc

    .gvimrc
        source ~/.dotfiles/gvimrc
