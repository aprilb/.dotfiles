My haphazard collection of dotfiles.

    http://sdt.github.com/.dotfiles/

The dotfiles themselves all lives in a .dotfiles subdirectory, to avoid my
whole home directory tree being a git repo.

There's three basic strategies to get various programs to use a dotfile outside
the usual place. In order of preference, they are:

  1. ~/.programrc includes ~/.dotfiles/programrc

    This of course requires the dotfile have some kind of include mechanism.

  2. Environment variable: PROGRAM_CONFIG=~/.dotfiles/programrc

  3. Shell alias: alias program='program --config-file=~/.dotfiles/programrc'


The included install.sh takes care of setting up the first form. It tries to be
idempotent, but should not be fully trusted.

The other forms are set up in bashrc.
